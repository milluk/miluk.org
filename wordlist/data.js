jsaction=\"rcuQ6b:rcuQ6b;\">\n\nInstant Phonetic\n  Englishization:  gwahn, rhymes with\n  ‘swan’.  Annie’s version of the word\n  begins with a Back G, made farther back in the throat than Lolly’s Mid\n  G.\n\nWhat to Imitate:  Students of the Milluk language only need to learn how Lolly Metcalf pronounces this Milluk word as / gwaan /, which is the first time that she says it.  The word appears in the Milluk texts, but only with the first syllable.  It appears there as | g̣wa·n | which we modernize to be | ɢ̣wa·n |.  Annie Miner Peterson’s version of the word begins with what we call a Back G, or call a ‘dotted G’.\n\nThe Easy-Way-to-Type Spellings as Phonemic Representations:  We treat our easy ways of typing the word as phonemic representations of the word by putting those spellings between sets of diagonal lines / / as opposed to putting them within square brackets [ ] as phonetic transcriptions.  That is because we make a point of making the easy-way-to-type spellings phonemic, which is to say by using the Milluk language’s own natural alphabet of distinctive speech sounds, which distinguish one Milluk word from another.\n\nOur easy-way-to-type spellings also happen to use only the letters of the Roman Alphabet, plus @ to represent the vowel Schwa [ ə ].  Because of that, some of the phonemes of Milluk are written with letters of the Roman Alphabet in combination.  For example, the Milluk word / chaachai / ‘walk’ has two syllables which each begin with the Milluk phoneme / ch /.  To hear that word, see the interview segments “Walk 1” and “Walk 2” on this website.  The sound / ch / is at the beginning and end of the English word ‘church’.  In our phonetic transcriptions, we write this sound as [ č ] in our Americanist phonetic transcriptions and as [ tʃ ] in our phonetic transcriptions in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).  In the IPA, affricate consonants are written as a stop consonant in combination with a fricative consonant, which is what they are phonetically.\n\nPhonemic Representations in Linguistics:  In linguistics, words and sentences which are written phonemically are not only enclosed between sets of diagonal lines / /, they are also written using standard phonetic symbols, such as / č / in the Americanist tradition of phonetic writing and the equivalent combination of [ tʃ ] which consists of IPA phonetic symbols.\n\nDaisy’s Version of the Word:  Lolly’s younger sister Daisy says the word with a second syllable.  At the beginning of the interview Daisy says that she never really spoke the Milluk language.  We only put what Lolly says in Milluk into our table of transcriptions.Lolly Metcalf actually does say the word as [ gwa·na ], but only after Daisy says it that way.  When Lolly says the word with a second syllable one can hardly even hear the second syllable.Later in the interview, in the interview segment “High”, we can hear Daisy say [ gwa·na ] again, which could even be transcribed as [ gwa·nʌ ].  It is hard to say what the exact tongue-height is for the vowel of the second syllable, since Daisy is so much in the background in that interview segment.  Daisy seems stuck on the idea that the word has a second syllable.  Even though we do not see the two-syllable form of the word in the Milluk texts, we have to take seriously the idea that such a form of the word might have actually existed in the language, just because of the fact that Lolly actually says it, even if it is very difficult to hear the short vowel at the end of Lolly’s two-syllable version of the word.  Because of all of this, the version of the word with a second syllable is really only a linguistic curiosity.\n\nDaisy’s Version of the Word:  Lolly’s younger sister Daisy says the word

even if it is very difficult to hear the short vowel at the end of Lolly’s two-syllable version of the word.  Because of all of this, the version of the word with a second syllable is really only a linguistic curiosity.\n\nTranslations: In the Milluk texts, Annie Miner Peterson only said this word as [ ɢ̣wa·n ].  Its most common translation is ‘up above’, but it is also translated twice as ‘above’.  In some lines of text, one can say that its translation is ‘up’.  Once it is translated as ‘up high’.  Once it is translated as ‘up in the air’, and once it is translated as ‘High above!’.  There are also lines of text where it is translated as ‘up on top of’, and ‘on top of’.  There is one translation of it in Annie Miner Peterson’s autobiographical text where it refers to ‘upstairs’ in a house.\n\nHow to Say ‘Heaven’ in Milluk: Students of the Milluk language should take special note of the fact that in the right context, the Milluk word / gwaan /, no matter which way you spell it and pronounce it, refers to heaven.  That is especially clear in two Milluk texts.\n\nThe Word in Sentences: At the beginning of the very last paragraph of the Trickster Epic, in Jacobs’ 1940 volume of Coos texts, on page 221, there are the sentences:\n\nThe very last line of the Trickster Epic, in Jacobs’ 1940 volume of Coos texts, on page 222, is the sentence:\n\nThe word also refers to heaven in the last four lines of the Milluk text titled “A mitʼɛ́·din shaman’s prayer when giving fresh fish and meat to a mourner after a burial”.  This is in Jacobs’ 1939 volume of Coos texts, on pages 91-92.  The last four lines of the text are:\n\nThe Velar-Uvular Sound Correspondence: No one should think that Lolly Metcalf is mispronouncing this word by saying it as [ gwa·n ], instead of saying it Annie Miner Peterson’s way of saying it as [ ɢ̣wá·n ].  This is one of several examples of a regular sound correspondence between Coos Bay Milluk, which has velar consonants in a number of words where Annie Miner Peterson’s Milluk has uvular consonants.  Uvular consonants are farther back in the throat than velar consonants.\n\nThe Shared Sound Correspondence: The same sound correspondence exists between Annie Miner Peterson’s Hanis (with velars) and Annie Miner Peterson’s Milluk (with uvulars) .  Hanis was also spoken along the shores of Coos Bay.  The shared sound correspondence suggests close contact between Coos Bay Milluk and Hanis.  The Native village called Milluk (present-day Charleston, Oregon) and the Native village called Hanis (the present-day Empire neighborhood of the city of Coos Bay) are only six miles apart.  One can drive between them nowadays in eight minutes without speeding.\n\nJacob’s Old-Fashioned Terminology: People should not be thrown off by the fact that Melville Jacobs in his 1939 volume of Coos texts, on page 13, in the section where he describes Coos phonetics, calls uvular consonants ‘velar’ consonants.  He refers to velar consonants as ‘medial palatals’.\n\nAn Equivalent Hanis Word: Mrs. Peterson’s Hanis equivalent of the Milluk word [ ɢ̣wa·n ] is the Hanis word [ ɢ̣ax̣ánč ], so Mrs. Metcalf’s pronunciation [ gwa·n ] cannot simply be a Hanis word.  One might imagine that Mrs. Metcalf is just saying a Hanis word, instead of saying a Milluk word, because of the shared sound correspondence between Coos Bay Milluk and Hanis, but that is not possible with this Hanis word which does not participate in the regular sound correspondence.\n\nOther Forms of the Word in Milluk: The word | ɢ̣wá·nʔniya | ‘become above’ is in a line of text where the whole line of text is translated as ‘He got to quite a height above’.  With a slightly different ending, the expression | ʔnə_ɢ̣wá·niyu | means ‘over me’, where the possessive pronominal proclitic [ ʔnə ] means ‘my’.  The word | ɢ̣wá·niyu |, wth this same slightly different ending is also in a line of text where its translation is ‘on top of’.",

the word as abruptly as if one\n  were ending it with t.\" jsaction=\"rcuQ6b:rcuQ6b;\">\n\nInstant Phonetic Englishization:\n  goos_min, like English ‘goose’ and ‘mint’, said as one word, but without\n  actually saying the t at the end, but ending the word as abruptly as if one\n  were ending it with t.\n\nLolly’s First Time Saying the Word:  When Swadesh asks Lolly to translate ‘always’ into Milluk, she finds herself saying something that ends with the English word ‘mint’.  However, the second time, she succeeds in saying the Milluk word / guusminʼ / ‘always’.  She ends the word with an unreleased glottal stop [ ʔ̚ ].  We suspect that that was exactly what she was trying to do the first time, when she accidentally said the English word ‘mint’.\n\nWhat We Do in English:  It happens that a very casual pronunciation of the English word ‘mint’ actually has some of us saying the word ending with an unreleased t [ t̚ ] which is simultaneous with an unreleased glottal stop [ ʔ̚ ].  We think that the second time that she tries to say the Milluk word / guusminʼ / ‘always’, she has a rather careful pronunciation of this Milluk compound word, where there is no t [ t ] at all, only an unreleased glottal stop.  That is very much like an extremely casual pronunciation of the English word ‘mint’, the way that some of us actually find ourselves saying it in rapid casual speech.\n\nWhat Threw Lolly Off:  We think that what threw Lolly off was not just 36 years of not having spoken Milluk with another speaker of Milluk, but the fact that she had already set her mind to saying Milluk words carefully at this point, some four minutes into the tape-recorded part of the interview.  In this case, she was trying to say a Milluk word carefully which ends just like an English word ends, but only when the English word is spoken very casually, where we swallow the final consonant which happens to involve a simultaneous unreleased glottal stop.\n\nDaisy Starting to Interrupt Lolly for Lolly’s Second Time Saying the Word:  Lolly’s younger sister Daisy noticed that Lolly had made a mistake saying / guusminʼ / ‘always’, the first time that Lolly tries to say it.  When Lolly is saying it the second time, the distinctive timbre of Daisy’s voice can be heard interrupting Lolly in the middle of the [ s ] at the end of the first syllable, but Daisy stops herself, to give Lolly a chance to finish saying what she is trying to say.  That is all we hear from Daisy in this interview segment.\n\nIn the Milluk texts, Jacobs wrote the Milluk word / guusminʼ / ‘always’ 39 times as | gu·s_min |, indicating that there is nothing phonetically special about how the word ends, but he wrote it 8 times as | gu·s_miɴ | where he indicates that there is something phonetically special about how the word ends.  When he wrote it 8 times as | gu·s_miɴ |, he may have heard Annie Miner Peterson say it ending with an unreleased glottal stop which is how we hear Lolly Metcalf say the word in this interview segment.  If he had heard it end with a released glottal stop, he would have indicated that there was a glottal stop at the end of the word, because he had a way to write that.  His use of a small capital n indicates a short cut-off syllable, which in this case would seem to have been an unreleased glottal stop.\n\nAn Old-Fashioned Pronunciation:  We have to suspect that Lolly’s pronunciation of the word is not just a careful pronunciation of the word but also an old-fashioned pronunciation of it.  When Melville Jacobs was taking text dictation from Annie Miner Peterson and he wrote this Milluk compound word / guusminʼ / ‘always’ 8 times as | gu·s_miɴ |, we have to suspect that Annie too was using an old-fashioned pronunciation of this word.  Our easy way of typing the word as / guusmin’ / is what we believe to be an old-fashioned pronunciation of it.  Apparently, it was normally pronounced as / guusmin / [guˑsmɪn] in Nineteenth Century Milluk, with no glottal stop at all, not even one muted by not being released.\n\nTroy’s two pronunciationsof the word follow how his great great grandmother, Lolly Metcalf, said the word guusmanʼ ‘always’, the second time that she attempted to say it.   It is especially Troy’s second token of the word, where it is easy to hear the phonetic effects of an unreleased glottal stop.",

word ‘on’, as\n  pronounced in Oregon, but with a short vowel, and wann (rhymes with\n  pan).\n\nThe Milluk expression an waen [ʔɑn wæˑn] ‘bad’ consists of the Milluk word an [ʔɑn] ‘not’, and the Milluk word waen [wæˑn] ‘thus’.  It would seem that earlier generations of Milluk speakers avoided saying the word that meant ‘bad’ to such an extent that the original word that meant ‘bad’ just dropped out of the language, replaced by this expression.\n\nIn the case of the Milluk word that means ‘not’, Jacobs consistently wrote the vowel of this word as a short vowel the many times that the word occurs in the Milluk texts.  Moreover, Jacobs use of a small capital n in his old-fashioned Americanist phonetic transcriptions, which we modernize as | ɴ | in our modernized Americanist transcriptions of the Milluk texts, is consistent with syllables being short.\n\nMelville Jacobs (1939, on page 12) says that his use of the small capital n indicates what he calls “shortened duration of sonancy”.  On page 15, he refers to this effect as “shortening of voicing in final sonant continuants”.  We wonder if this fully applies in the case of the Milluk word that means ‘not’, which he often wrote as ending with a small capital n.  What we wonder is whether he ever really heard the n of this word as partly devoiced or really heard aspiration before the n.  That is why in the table of transcriptions above we show three different transcriptions for this expression that we find in the Milluk texts, but we only give two explicitly phonetic transcriptions to cover the three transcriptions that we find in the Milluk texts.\n\nJacobs was not consistent in the matter of vowel length with the Milluk word waen ‘thus’.  This is a word which also occurs many times in the Milluk texts.  Because of Jacobs’ inconsistency about the vowel of this word being transcribed sometimes as a long vowel and sometimes as a short vowel, and because of what we hear of this word in sound recordings, we wonder if there is simply a short version of this very common Milluk word waen ‘thus’.  If we were to go with that idea, we could also write this word as wen in our easy way of writing Milluk words, in addition to writing it as waen, where our easy way of writing it implies both the vowel length that we hear in Lolly Metcalf’s pronunciation of the Milluk word waen ‘thus’ in the expression that means ‘bad’ and implies the vowel shape of [æ] that we also hear in Lolly Metcalf’s pronunciation of this Milluk word in this expression that means ‘bad’.  When we hear Annie Miner Peterson say this word in fluently spoken Milluk in originally phonographic recordings from 1934, we hear this word as much as [wɛn] as we hear it as [wæˑn], but those are examples of fluently spoken Milluk.\n\nWhile Jacobs was inconsistent about the length of the vowel in this particular Milluk word, he was instead ambiguous about the matter of the vowel shape of the vowel in this particular Milluk word.  In his old-fashioned Americanist phonetic transcriptions, he uses only the phonetic symbol epsilon [ɛ] to represent the phonetic vowels that we distinguish as [e], [ɛ], and [æ] in our explicitly phonetic interpretations of his old-fashioned Americanist phonetic transcriptions.\n\nHow we hear the Milluk phoneme /æ/ as a short vowel is affected somewhat by the fact that we are native speakers of English.  One of the differences between the phonemic vowel /æ/ in English, which we have in the English words ‘bad’ and ‘bat’, and the phonemic vowel /ɛ/, which we have in the English words ‘bed’ and ‘bet’, is that the English phoneme /æ/ is an inherently long vowel in English, while the English phoneme /ɛ/ is an inherently short vowel, in English.  The Milluk phoneme /æ/ can be either a long vowel or a short vowel.  When we hear the Milluk phoneme /æ/ as a short vowel in a Milluk word, even if it has the vowel shape of the phonetic vowel [æ], it is going to sound to us native speakers of English a bit like the phonetic vowel [ɛ], just because /ɛ/ is an inherently short vowel, in English.\n\nWhere it come to the Milluk word meaning ‘not’, and quite a few other words in Milluk, the challenge for native speakers of English is that the phonemic vowel /a/ in English, in the English word ‘father’, a vowel which we can just as well represent as /ɑ/, using the IPA symbol, is an inherently long vowel in the sound system of the English language.  That leaves aside the matter of entirely unstressed full vowels in English being reduced to schwa [ə].  In Milluk, the phoneme /a/ or /ɑ/, using either the Americanist or the IPA symbol, can be either a long or short vowel.  For its part in Milluk, schwa [ə] can be a stressed vowel.  That is something that does not happen in the kind of English that is generally spoken in Oregon.\n\nShort [ɑ] in Milluk and stressed schwa [ə́] both take some getting used to, for native speakers of the kind of English that is generally spoken in Oregon.  The Milluk word that means ‘not’, as we hear it from Lolly Metcalf, is a good place to hear the vowel [a], IPA [ɑ], as a short vowel.\n\nWe recommend that people imitate how Lolly Metcalf says the Milluk expression that means ‘bad’ as a basis for how to pronounce the Milluk word that we easily write as waen ‘thus’.  It is a good basis for pronouncing this word, no matter what we might have to say about how this words sounds in the fluently spoken Milluk that we can hear from Annie Miner Peterson and no matter what we might say about how this word sounded to Melville Jacobs as Annie Miner Peterson said it in the measured but still connected discourse of text dictation that produced the many examples of this Milluk word that we see in the Milluk texts.",

P. Harrington.  One Milluk word that Harrington wrote down from hearing Lottie Evanoff saying it was the word [ p‘æ´læˆl ] ‘black bear’.  Looking at Harrington’s transcription reminded us of something that we knew perfectly well, but had put aside as we have been making our phonetic transcriptions of Milluk words.  Harrington heard the first consonant of this word as an voiceless aspirated bilabial consonant.  In other words, Harrington heard the first consonant of this word as the same phonetic consonant which is the first consonant of the English word ‘pal’, which in purely phonetic terms is [ pʰæl ].  In the IPA, the turned apostrophe symbol [ ʽ ] indicates light aspiration.  Jacobs used that symbol to indicate (any amount of) aspiration, but almost never wrote the voiceless stop consonants at the beginnings of Milluk words as aspirated.  One way that Milluk and English are alike is that voiceless stop consonants at the beginnings of words are lightly aspirated.  Because English and Milluk are alike in this way, in making our transcriptions of Milluk words, we, along with Jacobs, have generally not bothered to bring out the fact that voiceless stop consonants at the beginnings of words in Milluk are lightly aspirated.  However, now Harrington has reminded us of the fact that they are.\n\nThe Tongue Height Range of the Milluk Phoneme /æ/ before /l/:  Harrington heard the vowel in the second syllable of this Milluk word as having a higher tongue height than the vowel [æ], but evidently not high enough in tongue height to cause him to transcribe it as [ɛ].  In other words, Lottie Evanoff pronounced the word in a way that is roughly halfway between Lolly Metcalf’s first pronunciation of the word as [ pʰælǽl ] and her second pronunciation of the word as [ pʰælɛ́l ], if you believe our phonetic transcriptions.",

quite a few words where Annie Miner Peterson’s pronunciations of the Milluk words have a uvular consonant.The Sound Correspondence with a Twist:  In this case though, with the Milluk word meaning ‘belly button’, there is a twist.  When we look at Melville Jacobs’ slip-file dictionary, we see that Mrs. Peterson has a Milluk word [qwá·lu] ‘navel’, ‘umbilical cord’ matching her Hanis word [gwə́ʔla] ‘navel’, ‘umbilical cord’.  The Hanis word begins with a voiced velar stop [ g ], instead of the expected voiceless velar stop [ k ].  There are two differences with this consonant, instead of there being just one difference.  In other words, Hanis and Coos Bay Milluk do not agree.  They have different words meaning ‘belly button’.\n\nThe k-q Sound Correspondence:  This is one of several

phonetic vowel [ i ] in the English word ‘keel’, but only the first time that Lolly says the word in this interview segment.  The second time that she says the word in this interview segment the vowel in the first syllable sounds more like the vowel [ ɪ ] in the English word ‘kill’.  We think that this is a result of the consonant at the beginning of that first syllable of the word having a built-in semivowel [ y ], because it is a palatalized consonant, made as if one were about to say the say the phonetic vowel [ i ], without actually saying the vowel.  In effect, there is an extra little [ i ] in the first syllable, enough of one to make at least some pronunciations of the word sound like they have the phonetic vowel [ i ] instead of the slightly lower, more cetralized, and lax phonetic vowel [ ɪ ].  In effect, we can hear that the first consonant of this word is a Front K because of this subtle effect that it has on how one can pronounce the vowel in the first syllable.  It is actually the variation of [ i ] versus [ ɪ ] that is the real clue, because the vowel in the first syllable of this Milluk word meaning ‘child’ is not a long vowel.  If it were a long vowel, that would be a reason for the vowel in the first syllable of this Milluk word to sound like the vowel in the English word ‘keel’, but then it would consistently sound like it had the vowel in the English word ‘keel’, rather than varying back and forth between that vowel [ i ] and the vowel in the English word ‘kill’ which is [ ɪ ].\n\nSingular and Plural Nouns:  This Milluk word means specifically ‘child’, rather than ‘children’.  The Milluk word meaning ‘children’ is a completely different word, [ hiˑmæ ] ‘children’, which can be typed easily as hiimae.  Most Milluk nouns have a single form which is both singular and plural.",

the English word ‘covered’.  In dictating the Milluk text titled “The trickster person who made the country”, which is found in Jacobs’ (1940) volume “Coos Myth texts”, Mrs. Peterson said:|

paragraph 12 of the text.  All of paragraph 12 is on page 189.In the same paragraph in the published version of the text and on the same notebook page in the field notebook, there is also the text line:| tsú‿dlúkʷda | ‘and (the young fellows) covered him over.’| tsú–dlʊ́kʷda | ‘Then they covered him there (the young fellows)’Again, the second version of the line of text here is in Jacobs’ handwriting, to be found in Jacobs’ field notebook 96, notebook page 155, where the translation is the one which is Jacobs’ handwritten translation,.  In his handwritten phonetic transcriptions, Jacobs makes a phonetic distinction between the phonetic vowel [ ʊ ] and the phonetic vowel [ u ], a matter of some interest to us here as we listen to the Milluk words that Lolly said when asked for

meaning 'cradle' underscores what we see in Coos comparative linguistics in general which is that there are a welter of sometimes contradictory sound correspondences.  That has everything to do with languages being in contact with each other over long periods of time.  Hanis and Milluk and then Coos Bay Milluk and Lower Coquille Milluk were evidently long in contact with each other, rather than having gone their separate ways.  That is a good part of the reason for Lolly Metcalf to have two rather different ways to say the Milluk word that means ‘red ceder root dipper basket’ which came also to mean ‘cup’.",

in this interview segment for this second word, but, we have a number of things to look into as we explore the wonderland of Milluk verbal forms in the Milluk texts and elsewhere.The First Word In This Interview Segment: The Milluk texts do not have a similar word.  In relation to what we think that we are hearing as [ kwɪnwɪsæ ] which is the first Milluk word in this interview segment, we are still puzzling over what to make of a phrase that we see in Jacobs’ handwriting on a sheet of paper that is a PDF currently titled “slipfile 11” in our overall Milluk database.  There we see [ ntg̣wənwəsɛʔ ] ‘I am filthy’.  The n in the middle of that word in Jacobs’ handwriting has a column of three little dots above it and has a column of four little dots below it.  The Hanis equivalent word is [ nʔn̩tgwənʔwəsɛʔ ] with the same meaning ‘I am filthy’.  That one-word phrase is like a Milluk word in Jacobs’ slip-file dictionary which is [ tg̣wə́nwəs ] ‘grave, dirt, dirty’.  The Hanis version of that word is [ tgwə́nʔwəs ] with the same meaning ‘grave, dirt, dirty’.The third person version of [ ntg̣wənwəsɛʔ ] ‘I am filthy’ might well  be *[ tg̣wənwəsɛʔ ] ‘It/he/she is filthy’.  Given the sound correspondences that we commonly see between Annie Miner Peterson’s Milluk and Lolly Metcalf’s Coos Bay Milluk, the Coos Bay Milluk equivalent of that might be *[ tgwɪnwɪsɛʔ ] ‘It/he/she is filthy’, with the possibility that the voiceless consonant [ t ] and the voiced consonant [ g ] might be reduced to the voiceless consonant [ k ].  That would get us to what we think

just by listening to what Lolly says in this interview segment for this second word, but, we have a number of things to look into as we explore the wonderland of Milluk verbal forms in the Milluk texts and elsewhere.\n\nThe First Word In This Interview Segment: The Milluk texts do not have a similar word.  In relation to what we think that we are hearing as [ kwɪnwɪsæ ] which is the first Milluk word in this interview segment, we are still puzzling over what to make of a phrase that we see in Jacobs’ handwriting on a sheet of paper that is a PDF currently titled “slipfile 11” in our overall Milluk database.  There we see [ ntg̣wənwəsɛʔ ] ‘I am filthy’.  The n in the middle of that word in Jacobs’ handwriting has a column of three little dots above it and has a column of four little dots below it.  The Hanis equivalent word is [ nʔn̩tgwənʔwəsɛʔ ] with the same meaning ‘I am filthy’.  That one-word phrase is like a Milluk word in Jacobs’ slip-file dictionary which is [ tg̣wə́nwəs ] ‘grave, dirt, dirty’.  The Hanis version of that word is [ tgwə́nʔwəs ] with the same meaning ‘grave, dirt, dirty’.The third person version of [ ntg̣wənwəsɛʔ ] ‘I am filthy’ might well

Milluk word in this interview segment that we think that we are hearing as [ kalwɪsæ ], we are reminded of the Milluk word that Lolly has as a translation of ‘dig’ in the interview segment “Dig”.  There, we figure that the root word in Lolly’s Coos Bay Milluk word that she has as a translation of ‘dig’ is [ kaʰl ] ‘underground’.  Because Swadesh had a partly alphabetical list of words to ask, the interview segment “Dig” and this interview segment “Dirty” happen to be one after the other in the interview, with “Dig” coming just before “Dirty” in the interview.  We wonder if another way to say ‘dirty’ in Milluk was to use that word referring to underground.  That thought is inspired by another way to say ‘dirty’ that we see in Jacobs’ handwriting on the sheet of paper that is a PDF currently titled “slipfile 11” in our overall Milluk database.  Annie Miner Peterson’s other way to say ‘dirty’ there is built around the Milluk word that means ‘mud’.",

Lolly only said twice the version of the word with [ ɪ ] in the second syllable, out of the five times that she says the word in that interview segment, and she did not even say the two examples of the word pronounced that way in a row.  She pronounced the word that way only after being badgered by Swadesh to speak louder.  The badgering to speak louder was something that she had put up with quite a bit by that point in the interview.  She was actualy speaking loud enough and she must have realized that.  Swadesh evidently wanted to have her repeat words without suggesting that there was anything wrong with how she was saying them.  Lolly evidently understood that too and seemed exasperated.  That is when she went beyond her own normal Coos Bay Milluk way of saying the word and said it in one of Annie’s two ways of saying the word which are evidently not the normal Coos Bay Milluk way of saying the word.  Something similar happens in the interview segment that we have online as

(including some people in linguistics, such as us to begin with) who might wonder how there could even be a sound change whereby ejectives would become voiced stop consonants.  The voiceless unaspirated pronunciation is a natural phonetic transition, but it is inherently unstable in a language such as Milluk where there is a contrast between voiced stop consonants, [ b, d, g, ɢ ] where one can exaggerate the identity of the consonant by making it more voiced, where there are also voiceless aspirated stop consonants [ pʰ, tʰ, kʰ, qʰ ], where one can exaggerate the identity of the

Frachtenberg (in his (1914) volume “Lower Umpqua Texts”, on page 119), using his very old-fashioned Americanist phonetic system of writing, transcribed the Lower Umpqua version of this word as [ kō ́tan ] ‘horse’.  On the other hand, in his (1913) volume “Coos Texts”, on page 206, Frachtenberg phonetically transcribed the Hanis word as [ kˑō ́tan ] ‘horse’.  In this transcriptions, his raised dot after the K is Frachtenberg’s very old-fashioned equivalent of Jacobs’ not quite so old-fashioned fronting diacritic [  ̯  ], which we see in Jacobs’ (1939) phonetic transcription of | k̯ú·tan | ‘horse’.\n\nAspirated Voiceless Stop Consonants:  One incidental fact about this word is that there is a slight amount of aspiration with the word-initial voiceless stop consonant of this word, because it is a word-initial Milluk voiceless stop consonant.  That applies whether we write it as a Front K [ k̯ ], following Jacobs transcription of the word in the Milluk texts, or whether we write it as the blatantly palatalized word-initial voiceless stop consonant that we hear from Lolly Metcalf in this interview segment.\n\nfor AMP:kyuutanAnnie Miner Peterson’s MillukExactly Jacobs’ transcriptionAmericanist Phonetic & IPAk̯ú·tan[kʰʸú·tan]&[ˈkʰʲuˑtan]\" jsaction=\"rcuQ6b:rcuQ6b;\">\n\nAn Extreme Example of a Front K [ k̯ ]:  In the Milluk texts, this word begins with what we call a Front K [ k̯ ], but, as we hear this word from Lolly Metcalf, it does not begin with a typical example of a Front K.  Instead of writing it as [k̯ʰú·tan], or [ˈkʲʰuˑtan] (in the IPA), we write it as [kʰʸú·tan], and [ˈkʰʲuˑtan] (in the IPA), as we hear it from Lolly.  The reason for this is that we do not want students of the Milluk language to think that there is normally as much of a semivowel [ y ] in a word-initial Front K as we hear in Lolly’s two times saying this word in this interview segment.  Lolly Metcalf says the first syllable of the Milluk word meaning ‘horse’ pretty much like the English word ‘cue’.  However, the word-initial Front K of this word is not typical of the instances of Front K which begin other words that we hear in sound recordings either from Lolly Metcalf or that we have heard so far from Annie Miner Peterson saying things in Milluk, as she was speaking into a phongraphic recording machine in 1934.",

credit for pronouncing the first consonant of this word as an ejective, but the ejective release of that first consonant is very slight for either of the two times that she says this word in this interview segment.  They might qualify as what we refer to in the interview segment “Moon” as a ‘zero-grade light pronunciation’ of an ejective, especially the second time that she says the word meaning ‘morning’ in this interview segment.  For her second pronunciation, we think that we hear that first consonant as a voiceless un-aspirated stop consonant, like the the k sound spelled with the letter c in the English word ‘scatter’.  In the case of other Milluk words, Lolly variously has ejectives which are emphatically ejective or lightly ejective, but there are cases like this where the ejective release is at about the vanishing point.",

says the word again as  [ha·ʔta·was]², where the [ t ] is also specifically voiceless un-aspirated.  However, the third time that she says the word, she pronounces it with a rather robust ejective, as [ha·ʔtʼa·was]².  That is how Jacobs heard Annie Miner Peterson pronounce that consonant.  It also happens that the third time that Lolly says the word, she has both a glottal stop before the consonant in question and she pronounces the consonant in question as an ejective.  See the interview segment “Salt” where the same thing happens, except that we cannot hear whether Lolly is saying the affricate consonant in that Milluk word as an ejective or not.  That, however, may be because in that word it would be the ejective [ tsʼ ] where the fricative release of the affricate makes it hard

Where it comes to Jacobs writing Schwa [ ə ] as a short unstressed vowel where we hear Lolly pronounce the vowel as [ ɪ ], see what we say about this in the interview segments “Nose ” and “Night”.  With those words, we found that, when Jacobs was making his slip-file dictionary, even though his transcriptions of those words in the Milluk texts have short unstressed Schwas [ ə ], he wrote on file slips that, in the syllables in question, the words had instead the vowel which he wrote as Iota [ ɩ ] which we modernize to be [ ɪ ].\n\nThe Other Way Around:  In the interview segment “Hair”, we

interview segment.  The word which really means ‘yellow’ is | k̯ʼisá·wəs | ‘canary, yel­low bird’ in both Hanis and Milluk.  It also appears on another file slip translated there just as ‘yellow’, and also marked as being the same in Hanis and Milluk.\n\nLink to the Sound File: Click on the link below to get to a page where there is a sound file of this interview segment.  Even though Swadesh fails to get Lolly Metcalf to say a Milluk word that means 'yellow', in this interview segment, we get to hear the Milluk word that means 'blue, green' two more times from her and we get confirmation from Lolly that it means both 'green', as well as 'blue'.https://soundcloud.com/miluk-org/yellow-try-lhm-interview/s-wko84\n\nLink to the Sound File: Click on the link below to get to a page where
