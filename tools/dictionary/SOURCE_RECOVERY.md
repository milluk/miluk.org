- `main` was deployed at `7b24d78c4132804110c2453e68ec0a2ad8034a69`.
- No remote movement had to be reconciled.

## Exhaustive authority inventory

`provenance/authoritative-directory-inventory.json` records all 2,118 regular
files under the authoritative MILUK directory in bytewise relative-path order:
64,600,989 bytes, 1,159 unique SHA-256 values, 962 root files, 360
extensionless files, 1,368 case-insensitive FIN paths, and 959 duplicate paths.
Every item has an explicit structural classification and pipeline disposition.

The former converter used `Path.glob('*.FIN')` at the directory root and
required exactly 684 matches. It therefore saw the canonical D-Z FIN set but
could not see the A-C consolidated tables or extensionless reference files.

The five newly admitted final-entry tables are:

| Original path | Bytes | SHA-256 | Rows |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| `ABC/DICT#.BYN` | 8,352 | `f170a116e25e0b2d05e8cdfefb133f1096d843963bc2e13f2dcf564225cbdf1c` | 58 |
| `ABC/DICT%.BYN` | 755 | `c73463cfdaf49d12b13db46b09d4b4f289e8db5328eb991d25c7e633177e312c` | 8 |
| `ABC/DICTA.BYN` | 4,472 | `239dd33ef1741292befe30e084ca8842fd44dac94791c50ee8c55abc39ae2ea0` | 35 |
| `ABC/DICTB.BYN` | 4,159 | `fb9ff1e571092d736a2d244b0fdfa0014770fcf7c4afacb7e25a2649b6b7482d` | 40 |
| `ABC/DICTC.BYN` | 1,745 | `3be526780158750551f1f53e81c8c8887a8f469df7e968e091676879a74a030e` | 24 |

They contain 165 numbered source rows. The literal root files Troy identified
are WordCruncher reference support, not the consolidated final-entry tables:

| Path | Bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| `#` | 555 | `ecc3855a8c793e9a73d41bf1f206b1aac7543e598878ab715bb3651a61dc7ace` |
| `%` | 214 | `5e0ece7ad4c8ef8a2be38e3686b1ea3324b9486864157d9a852aba10528e6095` |
| `A` | 658 | `6d2ffacb78823b3a59bb218cde94c8a540b86ad24c497dd14abecebec0aeb9f5` |
| `B` | 714 | `5293fd924b938ed71250ef89633cad6a58d8ed9eb161269480bf539c4ffbf863` |
| `C` | 580 | `175f541b6199569e17366370dd579b7c407511925dbefb191bc0ba7794707494` |

Each has a byte-identical `ABC/` copy. Both original path layers are archived
and hashed in `provenance/recovered-source-manifest.json`.

The admitted-source count is therefore 684 before recovery and 689 after
recovery. No other inventoried file matched an independent final-entry
container: every one of the remaining 1,429 authority items has an explicit
duplicate, support, archive, intermediate, or non-final disposition in the
exhaustive inventory.

## Character and alphabet authority

Jacobs's *Coos Phonetics from UWPA.pdf* is 11,673,201 bytes with SHA-256
`de8f1cd6abfb4a19088cc87e2fab564ac081b87d6de34f3596283a6ec9ab050f`.
The phonetic description is on printed pages 11-18. The historical mapping
guide, *Guide to Moving Melville Jacobs Materials from Handwritten to
Machine.docx*, is 3,006,624 bytes with SHA-256
`bdc74baa66c467d731f8ab9c9a44f93ca4e2bd4704d3cb45bc2605c718d31ba2`.
Together they establish `#` as barred l, `%` as `ɣ`, and the 1990 ASCII forms
of Jacobs's multi-character consonants.

Jacobs's complete phonetic inventory, grouped in his descriptive order, is:

- vowels: `ə a ɛ i u`;
- bilabial: `b p p' w w' m m'`;
- alveolar: `d t t' dz ts t's s s' n n'`;
- c-series: `dj tc t'c c c'`;
- anterior palatal: `g̯ k̯ k̯' x̯ x̯' y y'`;
- medial palatal: `g gw k kw k' k'w ɣ ɣ' ɣw x xw x'`;
- velar: `g̣ g̣w q qw q' q'w ɣ̣ ɣ̣' ɣ̣w x̣ x̣' x̣w`;
- faucal: `ʔ h hw`; and
- lateral: `dl tł t'ł l l' ł ł'`.

The historical keyboard map uses `@` for `ə`, `e` for `ɛ`, `!` for the
glottalization of ordinary stops, apostrophe in `t's`, `t'c`, and `t'#`, `&`
for the anterior-palatal inflection, `;` for the velar dot, `#` for `ł`, and
`%` for `ɣ`. Thus the crucial mappings are `c` → display `c` / search `sh`,
`tc` → display `tc` / search `ch`, `t'c` → display `t'c` / search `ch'`,
`t#` → `tł`, `t'#` → `t'ł`, `#` → `ł`, and `%` → `ɣ`. Search aliases do not
select the documentary display spelling.

### Initial-index presentation boundary

`KA.FIN` is preserved as the DOS-era source filename, but its filename is not
linguistic evidence that the “people, person” headword was simply `ka`.
`parse_dictionary.py` historically copied `Path.stem` into `headword`; that is
why entry `e0511-ka` and its generated navigation inherited `KA`. The protected
record's first Reference List form is `k!&a'`, which the authoritative converter
renders `k̯̓a'`. A guarded presentation rule now uses that exact surviving form
for the public header, indexes it beneath the existing Jacobs `k!&` unit
(displayed `k̯'` in the inventory), and leaves `KA.FIN`, `source_file`,
`headword_ascii`, `headword`, entry ID, and dictionary data unchanged. Unicode
canonical ordering yields `k&!` from the two combining marks, so initial
classification normalizes that ordering to the recovered inventory key `k!&`;
it does not posit a new phonetic unit.

The visible `x'` bucket was likewise a classifier artifact. Entry
`e1021-xinxinu` displays `x·ínx̣inu`, and its preserved form begins
`x:i<nx;inu`: the colon is the length mark rendered as a middle dot. The raw
classifier converted the middle dot back to a colon and then selected `x:` by
longest match, even though the Jacobs inventory uses that same key to name the
distinct glottalized `x'` unit. Presentation-aware classification now keeps
this length-bearing entry beneath `x`. Jacobs `x'` remains in the 68-unit
inventory but is unattested word-initially, so no `x'` tab is emitted.

The four recovered records `DICT#.BYN:3` through `DICT#.BYN:6` (entries
`e1114-l-e-nwi` through `e1117-l-u`) begin with raw `#:` and display barred L
plus length (`ł·`). The colon is therefore a length mark in these lexical
records, not evidence for word-initial Jacobs `ł′`. Initial classification
uses that converted presentation evidence to group the four beneath `ł`.
Jacobs `ł′` remains one of the 68 phonetic units but is unattested initially,
so no `ł′` index tab is emitted. The raw rows, entry IDs, and headwords are
unchanged.

`e0027-u-u` remains a Gate 2 read-only source-fidelity audit target for its
missing gloss and large form family; Gate 1 makes no inference or regrouping.

## Source duplicate

`DICT#.BYN:27` and `DICT#.BYN:28` have the same headword `#dja`, gloss
“ate/eat up,” primary citation, and alternate-form set. Row 28 is a strict
superset, adding extension `-t` and form `#dje\``. Both raw rows are retained.
The verified strict-superset exclusion admits 164 final entries from the 165
rows, producing 1,275 dictionary entries total. The retained entry traces to
both rows, with row 28 explicitly identified as the content-bearing superset.

## Identifier gate

All existing `e0001`-`e1111` identifiers and URLs remain unchanged. Recovered
entries append at `e1112` through `e1275`; no existing ID, URL, or internal
link is renumbered. The historical tables contain no stable identifiers.

## Documentary Z exception

The existing source `Z.FIN` (421 bytes, SHA-256
`e5d30ad24eace3cf3ef2bfb7ec9b22a56d75d2de69212f41abec438c723502e4`)
produces `e1111-z`, headword `z`, form `zu:<t'#u:c`, gloss “awful thing.”
Jacobs's authoritative inventory contains `dz` but no independent `z` unit.

The founder ruling retains a visible lowercase `z` index category for this literal 1990
source form. It does not reinterpret the entry as `DZ` and does not add an
independent `z` to Jacobs's phonetic inventory. The exception is constrained
in code and verification to entry `e1111-z`, source file `Z`, and ASCII
headword `Z`; every other independent-z initial fails generation. The entry's
literal form remains searchable.

## Before/after entries and attested index

The old 1,111-entry checkpoint and complete 1,275-entry result classify as
follows under the same Jacobs-aware longest-match rule. “Recovered” is the
mechanical difference between the two builds.

The 51 rows above are the complete attested initial-index inventory, already in
Jacobs order with the documentary exception last. The phonetic inventory has
68 units; the 18 unattested word-initial units are omitted from the visible
index rather than emitted as empty tabs.

## Dictionary font path

The site still requests Charis SIL remotely and retains Georgia/Times fallbacks;
no font files or dependencies were added. Chrome's receipt for `x̣` identified
a separate CSS defect: `.alpha`, generic `h2`, and `.crumb` explicitly selected
the system sans stack, so those linguistic index labels could never inherit the
body's Charis stack. The word-index alphabet and section headings, plus the
linguistic part of entry breadcrumbs, now select the serif/Charis stack. The
breadcrumb link and the rest of the navigation/interface chrome remain on the
system sans stack.
